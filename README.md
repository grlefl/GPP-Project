https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/Global-Privacy-Platform/blob/main/Core/Consent%20String%20Specification.md
- Digital property owners or CMPs are responsible for generating, persisting, and passing the GPP String.
- strings encoded with Fibonacci

Notes
- pull websites from top ## from Tranco (bigger or lesser depending on user counts for other analysis)
- check if companies use GPP in the first place
- then we make our own version of the CMP API to instantiate before website loads and see the stack trace of what websites access it ??

- get Semrush data, but this is a separate component that can be done whenever
