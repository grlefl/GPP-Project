# GPP Project

- Do publishers that have adopted the Global Privacy Platform (GPP) handle the Opt Out signal correctly?

Notes
- pull websites from top ## from Tranco (bigger or lesser depending on user counts for other analysis)
- check if companies use GPP in the first place
- then we make our own version of the CMP API to instantiate before website loads and see the stack trace of what websites access it ??

- get Semrush data, but this is a separate component that can be done whenever
